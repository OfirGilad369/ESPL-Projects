Questions:
1. Could you tell the location of each memory address?
2. What can you say about the numerical values? 
3. Do they obey a particular order?

Answers:
1. For the following output, we can say:
- &addr2: 0xffea4ecc - Stack address
- &addr3: 0xffea4ed0 - Stack address
- foo: 0x565a46e5 - Text Segment address
- &addr5: 0x565a6018 - Uninitialized Data (BSS) address

- addr0: 0x565a6008 - Initialized Data address
- addr1: 0x565a6010  - Uninitialized Data (BSS) address
- &addr6: 0x565a6014  - Uninitialized Data (BSS) address
- yos: 0x565a4970 - Text Segment address
- addr4: 0x578e4160 - Heap address
- &addr4: 0xffea4ed4 - Stack address

2. We can say that:
a) Variables declared in the Stack have address that start with: "0xff" (At the top of the memory)
b) Variables declared in the Heap have address that start with: "0x57" (Under the Stack)
c) Variables declared in the Initialized/Uninitialized Data and Text Segment have address that start with: "0x56" (Under the Heap)

3. Every new variable next to be used is declared above the old one and the space between them is based on the size of their declared type.
