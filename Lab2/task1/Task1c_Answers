Questions:
1. Given the results, explain to the TA what is the memory layout of arrays.
2. What can you say about the behavior of the '+' operator?

Answers:
1. for the output:
- int array value at index 0: 0xffea4e8c
- int array value at index 1: 0xffea4e90
- int array value at index 2: 0xffea4e94
- char array value at index 0: 0xffea4e99
- char array value at index 1: 0xffea4e9a
- char array value at index 2: 0xffea4e9b
- iarray: 0xffea4e8c
- iarray+1: 0xffea4e90
- carray: 0xffea4e99
- carray+1: 0xffea4e9a

we can say:


2. The behavior of the '+' operator is to move the pointer to point on the next address where the next variable is declared on the memory.
The jump is based of the size of the type of the variable we are jumping to.
In our case, for int variables we jumped 4 spaces (4 bytes), and for char variables we jumped 1 spaces (1 bytes).
