Task 0 theory questions:

1. The execution ends after execv although we loop infinitely for the reason that execv replaces the process that calls it with a different program,
and since the current process is now running a different program the loop will no longer continue.

2. we must place the full path of the executable file because with execv the first argument is a path for the executable and with execvp the first argument is a file name, 
and then it looks for the appropriate path. 

3. still wildcards are not working because wildcards are expanded by the shell,
and not by the execv or in the process which receives the command line.
